# portainer-stacks
Docker Compose stacks for Portainer to deploy as stacks.

## Updating static display content
- Edit files in `stacks/display.fishcitystudios.com/public`.
- Pull the repo on the host and redeploy the stack in Portainer (or let Watchtower update the container if you already use it).
